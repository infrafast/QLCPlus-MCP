# QLCPlus-MCP

QLCPlus-MCP is a TypeScript Model Context Protocol server for controlling **QLC+ 5 through its native network protocol**.

The server connects to the QLC+ Native Server, authenticates, downloads the active project, builds an in-memory Virtual Console inventory, and exposes safe MCP tools for discovery and button control.

OSC, WebSocket, `/vc.json`, static `widgets.json` runtime mappings and QLC+ 4 control are not part of the supported runtime.

## Features

- QLC+ 5 native TCP control on port `9998`.
- Automatic authorization/project-download lifecycle.
- Automatic reconnect and fresh inventory after QLC+ restarts.
- Runtime discovery of Virtual Console buttons and sliders.
- Exact button-caption execution with case-insensitive matching only.
- MCP over local STDIO or Streamable HTTP.
- Optional HTTP bearer authentication.
- Native connection/status reporting.
- Repository `PROMPT.md` exposed as an MCP prompt, resource and tool.

For implementation details, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Requirements

- Node.js `>=20.20.0` (Node 22 recommended).
- npm.
- QLC+ 5 with Native Server enabled.
- A QLC+ build compatible with upstream commit `984f0e7` or a release containing equivalent grouped native Virtual Console action behavior.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infrafast/QLCPlus-MCP.git
cd QLCPlus-MCP
npm ci
npm run build
cp .env.example .env
```

For same-machine QLC+ and local HTTP use, the defaults are intentionally loopback-only:

```text
MCP_TRANSPORT=http
HTTP_HOST=127.0.0.1
QLC_NATIVE_HOST=127.0.0.1
QLC_NATIVE_PORT=9998
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm run start:http
```

Health endpoint:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8788/health
```

MCP endpoint:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8788/mcp
```

QLC+ may display an authorization dialog for `QLCPlus-MCP`. Approve it once when required. The server becomes operational only after native state reaches `ready` and the current project inventory has been validated.

## QLC+ Native Setup

1. Start the supported QLC+ 5 build.
2. Enable the QLC+ Native Server.
3. Keep it on localhost whenever QLCPlus-MCP runs on the same machine.
4. Start QLCPlus-MCP.
5. Approve `QLCPlus-MCP` if QLC+ asks for authorization.
6. Check `qlc_get_state` or `/health` until state is `ready`.

On Linux/Raspberry Pi, localhost clients use a per-process address inside `127.0.0.0/8`. This lets QLC+ distinguish concurrent native clients without exposing port `9998` to the LAN.

## Widget Names

QLCPlus-MCP executes buttons by their complete QLC+ caption.

Matching ignores **case only**. Spaces and other characters remain part of the name:

```text
Blue Speed  == blue speed
blue speed  != blue_speed
blue speed  != bluespeed
```

Therefore a widget named **`blue speed` is fully supported**.

The agent may call:

```json
{
  "widgetName": "blue speed"
}
```

`qlc_button_press` validates the caption against the current native inventory before sending any QLC+ packet. A separate `qlc_list_widgets` call is not required when the user already supplied a complete caption.

Use `qlc_list_widgets` when discovering available controls, searching by a partial term, or recovering after an exact caption was rejected.

## MCP Tools

### `qlc_get_state`

Reports native lifecycle and runtime information including authorization, inventory generation, reconnect count and last successful action.

Only `ready` means a current project inventory is authorized and usable.

### `qlc_list_widgets`

Lists widgets discovered from the active project. Optional filters include widget type, text query and result limit.

Numeric QLC+ widget IDs are session-only and can change after project reload/reconnect.

### `qlc_button_press`

Executes one complete Virtual Console button caption.

- case-insensitive only;
- spaces significant;
- accents significant;
- punctuation significant;
- `_` and `-` significant;
- no substring/fuzzy substitution.

Flash buttons are sent as press/release; normal toggle-style buttons are press-only.

### `get_agent_prompt`

Returns [PROMPT.md](PROMPT.md), the recommended lighting-agent instructions.

The same content is also available as MCP prompt `agent_prompt` and resource `agent://prompt/system`.

## STDIO Mode

For an MCP host running on the same machine:

```bash
npm run start:stdio
```

Example MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "qlcplus": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/QLCPlus-MCP/dist/src/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "QLC_NATIVE_HOST": "127.0.0.1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`PROMPT.md` is discovered automatically from the QLCPlus-MCP installation, even when the MCP process is launched with another working directory. `MCP_PROMPT_FILE` is needed only to deliberately override the bundled prompt.

Build the project before using `dist/src/index.js`.

## HTTP Mode

HTTP defaults to loopback for safety:

```text
HTTP_HOST=127.0.0.1
HTTP_PORT=8788
HTTP_MCP_PATH=/mcp
```

For direct network access, explicitly bind to a network interface and enable bearer auth:

```bash
HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
MCP_AUTH_MODE=bearer \
MCP_AUTH_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
npm run start:http
```

For the validated Raspberry Pi rack deployment, direct network binding is not required: keep `HTTP_HOST=127.0.0.1` and publish the service through Tailscale Funnel instead.

### Validated Tailscale Funnel endpoint

The rack setup exposes QLCPlus-MCP through the Raspberry Pi's stable Tailscale hostname under `/qlc`:

```text
Local MCP    : http://127.0.0.1:8788/mcp
Public MCP   : https://raspberrypi-1.tail70348.ts.net/qlc/mcp
Public health: https://raspberrypi-1.tail70348.ts.net/qlc/health
```

Configure Funnel with:

```bash
sudo tailscale funnel --https=443 --set-path=/qlc --bg 8788
```

Expected proxy path:

```text
https://raspberrypi-1.tail70348.ts.net/qlc
        ↓
http://127.0.0.1:8788
```

Keeping QLCPlus-MCP bound to loopback means port `8788` is not exposed directly on the LAN while Funnel provides the public HTTPS endpoint.

The public `/health` endpoint intentionally exposes only minimal service/native readiness information. It never exposes the bearer token, native encryption key, or generated authenticated client configuration.

Authenticated endpoints include `/mcp/status`, `/mcp/logs`, `/mcp/tools`, `/mcp/resources`, and the MCP endpoint itself.

## Configuration

Environment files are searched in this order:

1. `QLCPLUS_MCP_ENV_FILE`
2. `/etc/qlcplusmcp.env`
3. `/config/.env`
4. `config/.env`
5. `.env`

The repository does **not** track a machine-specific `config/.env`.

Main variables:

```text
MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio|http
HTTP_HOST=127.0.0.1
HTTP_PORT=8788
HTTP_MCP_PATH=/mcp
MCP_AUTH_MODE=none|bearer
MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=...

QLC_NATIVE_HOST=127.0.0.1
QLC_NATIVE_PORT=9998
QLC_NATIVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=
QLC_NATIVE_RECONNECT_MS=2000
QLC_NATIVE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
QLC_NATIVE_MAX_PROJECT_SIZE=16777216
QLC_NATIVE_CLIENT_NAME=QLCPlus-MCP

QLC_DRY_RUN=false
MCP_PROMPT_FILE=/optional/custom/PROMPT.md
LOG_LEVEL=info
NODE_ENV=production|development
```

Native QLC+ control is always enabled because it is the only supported QLC+ runtime path. There is no `QLC_NATIVE_ENABLED` setting. Use `QLC_DRY_RUN=true` when you intentionally want the MCP to open no QLC+ socket and send no live action.

Legacy OSC-era variables such as `QLC_ALLOW_RAW_OSC`, `QLC_HOST`, `QLC_OSC_INPUT_PORT`, `QLC_OSC_OUTPUT_PORT`, `QLC_UNIVERSE` and `QLC_WIDGETS_FILE` are not read and should be removed from deployment configuration.

`dotenv` is configured quietly by the application, so `DOTENV_CONFIG_QUIET` is not required.

`MCP_PROMPT_FILE` is optional and normally unnecessary; it exists only for a deliberate custom prompt override.

## Raspberry Pi Service

The `qlcplusmcp_raspi_service_pack` directory contains the systemd service, environment template, installer and helper command.

Typical installation:

```bash
cd /home/pi/QLCPlus-MCP
npm ci
npm run build
cd qlcplusmcp_raspi_service_pack
chmod +x install_qlcplusmcp_service.sh
./install_qlcplusmcp_service.sh
qlcplusmcp auto
qlcplusmcp health
```

The installer:

- creates `/etc/qlcplusmcp.env` only if it does not already exist;
- preserves existing runtime configuration on reinstall;
- stores the environment file with mode `600`;
- defaults HTTP to `127.0.0.1`;
- defaults QLC+ native control to `127.0.0.1:9998`;
- documents the validated public Funnel endpoint `https://raspberrypi-1.tail70348.ts.net/qlc/mcp`.

Useful commands:

```text
qlcplusmcp start
qlcplusmcp stop
qlcplusmcp restart
qlcplusmcp status
qlcplusmcp logs
qlcplusmcp health
qlcplusmcp endpoint
qlcplusmcp test-remote
qlcplusmcp auto
qlcplusmcp noauto
qlcplusmcp config
```

`qlcplusmcp endpoint` prints both the local and validated public MCP URLs. `qlcplusmcp test-remote` checks the Funnel health endpoint.

## Docker

Build/run with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The container exposes only the MCP HTTP TCP port. No OSC UDP port is exposed.

By default Docker Compose uses `host.docker.internal` as the QLC+ native target. Override `QLC_NATIVE_HOST` when QLC+ is reachable elsewhere.

If HTTP is published beyond a trusted local host, enable bearer authentication.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run test:ci
```

Watch mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Formatting:

```bash
npm run format
```

GitHub Actions runs build and tests on Node 20.20 and Node 22 for pull requests and `main` pushes.

Generated `dist/` output is not tracked in Git. Build it locally or in the deployment image/service before starting the compiled entry point.

## Troubleshooting

### Native state never reaches `ready`

Check:

- QLC+ 5 Native Server is enabled;
- `QLC_NATIVE_HOST` and `QLC_NATIVE_PORT` are correct;
- QLC+ authorization has been approved if prompted;
- the QLC+ build is compatible with the required native protocol behavior;
- the project transfer is not rejected by the configured size limit.

### Exact button not found

Call `qlc_list_widgets` and compare the complete caption. Do not remove spaces or replace them with underscores.

For example, if the inventory contains `blue speed`, call exactly `blue speed` (case may differ), not `blue_speed` or `bluespeed`.

### HTTP client receives 401

When `MCP_AUTH_MODE=bearer`, send:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>
```

### QLC+ restarts

QLCPlus-MCP invalidates the old inventory, reconnects, downloads the fresh project and returns to `ready`. Numeric widget IDs from the old session are never treated as persistent identifiers.
